**Preparation Instructions:**

1. **Mushroom Souvlaki:**
   - In a large bowl, mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.
   - Add the tofu cubes (or mushroom mix) to the marinade, ensuring all pieces are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to 2 hours for more flavor).
   - Preheat the grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.
   - Thread the marinated tofu (or mushrooms) onto skewers, leaving a little space between each piece.
   - Grill the souvlaki for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the tofu is golden and slightly charred (or mushrooms are tender and juicy).

2. **Tzatziki Sauce:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the Greek yogurt (or plant-based yogurt), grated cucumber (make sure to squeeze out excess water), minced garlic, olive oil, dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
   - Mix until well combined and adjust seasoning to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

3. **Greek Salad:**
   - In a large bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, diced cucumber, bell pepper, sliced onion, feta cheese (or plant-based feta), and black olives.
   - Drizzle with olive oil and red wine vinegar, sprinkle oregano, salt, and pepper, and toss gently to mix.

4. **Pita Bread:**
   - If using store-bought pita bread, warm them in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 1-2 minutes on each side or wrap in aluminum foil and heat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 5-7 minutes.
