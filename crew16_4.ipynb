Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to 2 hours for more flavor).\\n   - Preheat the grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.\\n   - Thread the marinated tofu (or mushrooms) onto skewers, leaving a little space between each piece.\\n   - Grill the souvlaki for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the tofu is golden and slightly charred (or mushrooms are tender and juicy).\\n\\n2. **Tzatziki Sauce:**\\n   - In a mixing bowl, combine the Greek yogurt (or plant-based yogurt), grated cucumber (make sure to squeeze out excess water), minced garlic, olive oil, dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.\\n   - Mix until well combined and adjust seasoning to taste.

Tofu absorbs the marinade beautifully, while mushrooms offer umami and depth.\\n- Greek yogurt remains unchanged but can be swapped for a plant-based yogurt to cater to vegan diets.\\n- Feta cheese is replaced with a plant-based version for those who prefer dairy-free options while keeping the tangy flavor intact.\\n- The overall preparation and cooking methods remain the same, ensuring that the essence of the Greek dinner is preserved while being adapted to a vegetarian-friendly meal.'"
