The world of cinema is a realm of dreams, creativity, and sometimes, costly miscalculations. In 2024, several high-profile films hit the big screen, only to stumble significantly at the box office. Despite lavish budgets and star-studded casts, these movies fell short of expectations, leaving studios with hefty financial losses and audiences scratching their heads. Let's dive into the biggest box office flops of 2024 and explore what went wrong.

## 1. Megalopolis: A Grand Vision That Crashed
**Budget**: $120-136 Million  
**Box Office**: $13.9 Million  

Directed by legendary filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, "Megalopolis" aimed to reimagine New York City as a utopia. However, the ambitious sci-fi drama failed to connect with viewers, recovering only about 10% of its production costs. The film had been in development for decades, and its underwhelming performance sparked significant discussion in the film community about the difficulties of translating grand visions into commercial success.

**Budget**: $100 Million

Despite featuring Hollywood heavyweights like Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, "Fly Me to the Moon" struggled to find its footing at the box office. The film's confusing marketing strategies and poor release planning limited its audience reach. Originally intended for direct-to-streaming, the decision to launch it theatrically fell flat, resulting in lackluster ticket sales. Interestingly, the premise—a romantic comedy set against a lunar backdrop—was intriguing but ultimately failed to attract viewers.
